# OAuth

## 1. What is OAuth?

- **OAuth** (Open Authorization) is an **authorization framework** that allows third-party applications to **access a user's resources** (like their data) **without exposing their username and password**.  
- Instead of sharing credentials, the user authorizes a third-party app to access their resources via access tokens.

### ðŸ”¹ Example: Login with Google
When you click on "Login with Google" on a new app, that app uses OAuth to access your Google profile without getting your password.

## 2. OAuth Flow

1. User clicks on **"Login with Google"**.  
2. Client redirects to the **Authorization Server** (Google).  
3. User logs in and grants permission.  
4. Authorization Server returns an **authorization code** to the client.  
5. Client exchanges this code for an **access token**.  
6. Client uses the access token to access resources from the **Resource Server**.

**Note:** The above flow is for **Authorization Code Grant Type**.

### ðŸ”¹ Tokens

- **Access Token:** Short-lived token used to access resources.  
- **Refresh Token:** Used to get a new access token when the old one expires, without re-authenticating.

## 3. Access Token vs Refresh Token

- When we hit the OAuth endpoint, the **Authorization Server** returns:
  - **Access Token**  
  - **Refresh Token**  
  - **Expiry times** for both tokens  

- **Access Token:**  
  Used in API calls to fetch data. It has a short lifetime.  

- **Refresh Token:**  
  Has a longer lifetime. When the access token expires, the app uses the refresh token to request a new access token **without asking the user to log in again**.  

- When the refresh token also expires (after several days), the user must log in again to get a new access token and refresh token.
