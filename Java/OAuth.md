# OAuth

## 1. What is OAuth?

**OAuth** (Open Authorization) is an **authorization framework** that allows third-party applications to **access a user's resources** (such as data) **without exposing their username and password**.  
Instead of sharing credentials, the user authorizes a third-party app to access their resources via access tokens.

### ðŸ”¹ Example: Login with Google
When you click on "Login with Google" on a new app, that app uses OAuth to access your Google profile without getting your password.
