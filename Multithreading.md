## 2. What is Thread?
- In Java, a **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
- Multiple threads can run concurrently within the same process and share the same memory and resources.
- Threads operate independently but can communicate and coordinate with each other.   
- **Eg:** VLC Media Player is a process, and within it, multiple small tasks like Video, Music, Timer, Progress Bar, etc., are executed. These small tasks are called threads.
